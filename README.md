## Story

The main protagonist of the game is a pre-school pupil who found himself living through a nightmare.

The morning started like any other, with the young kid waking up in his room. As usual, he headed to the kitchen to greet his parents. On the way there, he stumbled upon a note laying on the floor of the corridor leading to the kitchen. 

The note was barely readable. The only words that could comprehensible text ordered to head straight into the study room. Deciding to ignore the notes command until having a snack, the boy continued marching towards the kitchen, only to find it shut with three padlocks.

He cried for help for his parents, no-one answered. It was dead quiet. There was no other choice but to do what the paper note asked. 

Finally, inside the study room, a cold sweat struck the boy, as heâ€™d discovered that the place was brightly lit; by a door leading into a neon-blue tunnel. He recalled his parents arguing about renovating, but not to this extent?!

The young lad gathered all his courage, carefully entered the tunnel, and paced into the unknown. To no spectators surprise, the entrance passage behind him closed, leaving the brave boy only one choice of direction.
